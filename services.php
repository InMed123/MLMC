                  <h4>CT</h4>
                  <p>CT or Computed Axial Tomography, formerly known as a CAT scan, combines x-ray technology with advanced computer technology.</p>
                  <p>The major benefit of CT is its ability to show internal anatomy in cross-sections, commonly 
                     referred to as slices.
                  </p>
                  <p>The most common analogy used to describe the cross-sectional view is that of a slice out of a loaf of bread. In CT scanning, the slices are very thin millimeter sections capable of revealing tiny abnormalities.</p>

               <div class="row text-box-grey">
                  <h4>Ultrasound</h4>
                  <p>Ultrasound or Diagnostic Sonography utilizes sound waves to produce images of internal organs and vessels. This information is useful for the diagnosis of a range of pathologies. Every exam is read by a board certified Radiologist and/or Cardiologist. The results are faxed directly to your doctor usually within 24-48 hours of your exam.</p>

                  <h4>Mammography</h4>
                  <p>The best defense against breast cancer is to find it as early as possible, when it is easiest to treat.  Preventative measures such as screening mammograms can assist in early response to breast cancer. Screening mammograms are performed on women who do not have any symptoms. If something is found after a screening mammogram, then a diagnostic mammogram and possibly an ultrasound are performed to determine if a lump or other symptom is a sign of breast cancer. </p>

                  <h4>About Mountain Lakes Medical Centerâ€™s Open MRI</h4>
                  <h4>MRI</H4>
                  <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technology that allows your physician to see inside your body without surgery or potentially harmful ionizing radiation.  MRI utilizes a strong magnetic field along with radio waves to produce an image.  </p>
                  <h4>What is an Open MRI?</h4>
                  <p>Open MRI technology is designed for patients that are claustrophobic or anxious when placed in a confined place and are sensitive to noises.  Unlike closed MRI, Open MRI technology is open on three sides to give you the feeling of unobstructed space in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
                  <h4>Is there any risk?</h4>
                  <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging is very safe.  There are no health risks associated with the magnetic or the radio waves used by the machine.  However, some special circumstances limit the use of a magnetic field.  It is important for you to tell us if you have any of the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Cardiac pacemaker or artificial heart valve</li>
                     <li>Metal plate, pin or other metallic implant</li>
                     <li>Intrauterine device, such as Copper-7</li>
                     <li>Insulin pump or other infusion pump</li>
                     <li>Aneurysm clips</li>
                     <li>Previous gun wound</li>
                     <li>Inner ear implant</li>
                     <li>Metal fragments in your eye or other parts of your body</li>
                     <li>Permanent (tattoo) eyeliner</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>How long will the exam take?</h4>
                  <p>The length of the exam depends on the type of MRI exam your doctor has ordered.  Most exams are completed within 30 to 60 minutes.</p>
                  <h4>How do I get my exam results?</h4>
                  <p>After your exam, a radiologist will review your images and a report will be sent directly to your doctor.  Reports are typically available within 24 hours.  Your doctor will discuss the results of the exam with you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <strong>Triage:</strong> Every patient seen in the Emergency Room is first evaluated by a nurse, a process we call "triage." The nurse will ask you to briefly describe your illness or injury. She/he will then examine you to determine which division of the Emergency Department is most appropriate for your situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Medical Examination:</strong> After Triage, you will be directed to a treatment room for an examination by one of Mountain Lakeâ€™s physicians.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Registration:</strong> Once you examination is complete, you will be registered as an out-patient. A member of our administrative staff will take a couple of minutes to ask you the usual questions â€“ address, employer, insurance plan, friend or relative to notify in the event of further emergency, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Admission to the Hospital:</strong> If you need to be admitted, we will contact your primary care physician.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Discharge:</strong> Upon discharge, you will be provided instructions by the nurse or physician. If necessary, prescriptions may be sent electronically to be filled at the pharmacy of your choice.

<p>Mountain Lakes Medical Center has been awarded a three-year term of accreditation in mammography as the result of a recent review by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Mammography is a specific type of imaging test that uses a low-dose x-ray system to examine breasts. A mammography exam, called a mammogram, is used to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast diseases in women.</p> 

<p>The ACR gold seal of accreditation represents the highest level of image quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting ACR Practice Guidelines and Technical Standards after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified physicians and medical physicists who are experts in the field. Image quality, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures, and quality assurance programs are assessed. The findings are reported to the ACR Committee on Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report they can use for continuous practice improvement.</p> 

<p>The ACR is a national professional organization serving more than 36,000 diagnostic/interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services.

                  Mountain Lakes Medical Center offers adult sleep testing services to diagnose and treat a spectrum of sleep disorders.  Problems such as snoring, insomnia and daytime sleepiness may mean that you, like 20 million other Americans, have a sleep disorder.     
               </p>
               <p>
                  Sleep disorders are directly linked to health problems such as heart disease, adult onset diabetes, stroke, ADD in children, and depression.  If sleep problems are causing you to have health problems, making you irritable or depressed, or have affected your concentration, see your doctor to determine if sleep testing can provide answers and solutions.

               <h4>How would I know if I have a sleep problem?</h4>
               <p>Significant sleep disorders presently affect approximately 25 percent of the general population. Adults should feel refreshed and ready to face the day after 7.5 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. If you often feel unable to perform throughout the day, this is an indicator of a possible night time problem.</p>
               <h4>How are sleep disorders diagnosed?</h4>
               <p>The starting point is a good sleep history obtained by talking with your physician who can order a study for you if appropriate. The most common sleep disorders are diagnosed by having a sleep study done in a controlled environment which is a bedroom-like setting at the hospital. Patients are monitored throughout their normal sleep period, whether that is at night or even during the day for individuals who perhaps routinely work a night shift.</p>
               <h4>What is a sleep study?</h4>
               <p>Sleep studies at Mountain Lakes Medical Center monitor all activities that occur during the night in a homelike environment. A sleep technologist attaches small metal discs called electrodes to the head and skin with an adhesive, plus other simple probes to measure breathing, heart rate and the bloodâ€™s oxygen level.  The technical equipment and technologist are in a nearby room monitoring all activities.</p>
               <h4>Will my insurance cover a sleep study?</h4>
               <p>Most insurance companies cover sleep studies and consider them and a valuable diagnostic tool to aid in managing overall health. </p>
               <h4>How can I schedule a sleep study?</h4>
               <p>Your primary care physician can schedule a study on your behalf or you may contact Mountain Lakes Medical Center directly at 706.782.0412 for further information. </p>
